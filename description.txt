~ghostblocks~
Code by ProgrammingChicken
Uses textures from enabled texture pack.
ghostblocks are blocks which you can walk through.
you craft them using the ghost-converter.
g-converter converts regular blocks into ghostblocks with fuel and "ghost-essence"
g-essence is obtained by digging coal and stone.
coal gives 0.1 g-essence
stone gives 0.05 g-essence
to convert one block you need 15 g-essence and 4 seconds of fuel.
so you would need to dig 300 stone or 150 coal to make one.
very expensive, but *realistic*.
